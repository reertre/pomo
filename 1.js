Given the folder path in the screenshot, let’s ensure Python correctly identifies utils as a module. Since the ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'utils' error persists, we can try a few adjustments.

Solution: Adjust Python Path and Run from Project Root

1. Navigate to the Project Root Directory:

It appears you’re currently inside the codes directory. Try navigating one level up to the root directory, which likely contains utils, fields, and any other project folders. In your case, that should be:

C:\Programs\python\SDS_BOOK\flexible-reporting\codebase\aayush\sds_common_code_development



2. Run test.py with an Absolute Path:

Once you’re in the root directory, run test.py with the following command:

python codes/utils/test.py



3. Set PYTHONPATH Explicitly:

Alternatively, you can set PYTHONPATH to the root directory to ensure Python recognizes utils as a package.

Run these commands:

On Windows:

set PYTHONPATH=C:\Programs\python\SDS_BOOK\flexible-reporting\codebase\aayush\sds_common_code_development
python codes/utils/test.py

On Mac/Linux (if relevant):

export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/your/project/root
python codes/utils/test.py




4. Modify test.py to Add the Root Path Temporarily:

If you still encounter issues, modify test.py to explicitly add the root directory to the system path. Update test.py as follows:

import sys
import os

# Add the project root to the Python path
sys.path.append(os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '../../..')))

from utils.api.system import System

# Test code
system_instance = System()
active_systems = system_instance.get_all_active()
print(active_systems)

Here, ../../.. assumes test.py is three directories deep from the root. Adjust the path as needed if your structure differs.





Verify __init__.py Files

Ensure that every directory (utils, api, and any subdirectories) has an __init__.py file. This will allow Python to recognize these directories as packages and make imports smoother.

Summary

1. Navigate to the root project directory.


2. Set PYTHONPATH or modify test.py to add the root to the system path.


3. Ensure every folder in the import path has an __init__.py.



Try these steps and let me know if it successfully resolves the ModuleNotFoundError.
